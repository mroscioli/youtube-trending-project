# Data directory

This folder is intentionally excluded from version control.

## Required datasets
To run the notebook, create the following folder:

data/trendingYT/

and place all dataset files inside it:

- *videos.csv.zst (e.g. CAvideos.csv.zst, USvideos.csv.zst, ...)
- *_category_id.json (e.g. CA_category_id.json, US_category_id.json, ...)

## Note
The dataset files are not included in this repository because they are large.
They are ignored by `.gitignore`.
